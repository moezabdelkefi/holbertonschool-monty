A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks can be implemented using an array or a linked list.

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Queues can also be implemented using an array or a linked list.
